      Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
      creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
      and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World
      Wide Web.
      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
      storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
      the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
      the appearance of the document.
