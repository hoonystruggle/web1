    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>JavaScript</strong> <u>(/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/)</u>, often abbreviated as JS, is a
      high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the
      ECMAScript specification. It is a programming language that is
      characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.
      Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the
      World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an
      essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,
      and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
